Backgroud: Digital deposits are a newer deposit option offered by banks, featuring higher interest rates compared to traditional deposits. However, customers can only conduct transactions using self-service machines or mobile banking due to the absence of physical bank branches. This allows banks to offer better interest rates due to reduced operational costs.
