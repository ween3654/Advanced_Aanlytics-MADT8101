# Customer Segmentation and product recommendation

## 🏕️ Part1: Customer Segmentation: 
The the process of divide customers into groups based on same characteristic or behaviors. Business can design product or services that corresponding  of each customer behaviors’ group.

## Workshop
HDI is a networking marketing business, located in multiple countries in South East Asia. Its products are honey, propolis, royal jelly and pollen etc.

💠 Dataset: used in this Workshop has 4 files consisting of 
  (1) member data: customer information and membership date 590,566 records 
  (2) transaction2021 Transaction data 1,048,576 records 
  (3) transaction2022 Transaction data 995,633 records 
  (4) transaction2023 Transaction data 362,109 records

▶️ First Step: Data preperation
Because data kept in transaction form, we union all transaction file and then group data into customer single view. The feature we select to do clustering consisting of 

  1) Frequency: Number of times a customer purchases products within a period of 1 year.
  2) Avg. Spending: average purchase amount per time (Total amount/frequency)
  3) Avg. Discount: average discount (1-(paid amount/Total amount))
  4) Mean Time Between Purchase: Average time between purchases (last payment date-first payment date)/frequency
  5) Offline ratio: Proportion of the number of times purchased through offline channels compared to the total number of times purchased.
  6) Online ratio: Proportion of the number of times purchased through online channels compared to the total number of times purchased.

Then, transform the data for K-Means clustering by adjusting it to follow a Gaussian Distribution.

▶️ 2nd Step: Clustering using Autoencoder

>> Determine the number of customer data clusters using the Elbow Method based on the chart. The appropriate number of clusters for the dataset should be divided into 4 clusters (k=4).
