# Advanced_Analytics-MADT8101

This project is a part of the curriculum for the Advanced Analytics Seminar (MADT8101) within the Master of Science Program in Analytics and Data Technologies at NIDA Thailand. The course offers both theoretical knowledge focused on Customer Analytics and practical hands-on workshops.

**Instructor:** Dr. Thanachart Ritbumroong

## Section 1.1: Customer Data Platform
- [Customer Data Platform](https://github.com/ween3654/Advanced_Aanlytics-MADT8101/blob/main/section1.1_Customer%20Data%20Platform/readme.md) üåê  <br>
In this section, we delve into the concept of a Customer Data Platform (CDP), which serves as a centralized and comprehensive repository designed to store and manage customer and potential customer data. We summarize the steps to create a CDP and provide an example of a CDP at Commonwealth Bank.

## Section 1.2: Customer Single View
- [Customer Life time Value](https://github.com/ween3654/Advanced_Aanlytics-MADT8101/blob/main/section1.2_Customer_Sing_View/readme.md) üéØ <br>
 The Customer Single View is a crucial concept that integrates all relevant customer data into a single row for each customer. This empowers analysts and data scientists to gain deep insights into customer behavior. To grasp this concept better, we'll work with the 'supermarket' dataset in our workshop. Our primary objective is to enhance overall supermarket sales, and the workshop is divided into three main parts: 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 2. Creating the Customer Single View 3. Segmenting customers using KMeans clustering.


## Section 2: Customer Life Time Value and Customer Scoring
- [Customer Life time Value and Customer Scoring](https://github.com/ween3654/Advanced_Aanlytics-MADT8101/blob/main/section2%3A%20customer%20life%20time%20value/readme.md) üìà  <br>
 In today's highly competitive marketplace, understanding your customers is paramount. We explore two key metrics, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer Scoring, which provide invaluable insights into customer behavior. During the workshop, we discuss how to redesign Agoda's loyalty program by incorporating CLV concepts. Additionally, we offer strategies on utilizing both loyalty programs and customer scoring to craft personalized offers.

## Section 3: Churn Prediction
- [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/ween3654/Advanced_Aanlytics-MADT8101/blob/main/section3%3A%20Churn%20Prediciton/readme.md) üòü <br>
 Churn Prediction is a data-driven process employed by businesses to identify and predict which customers are more likely to discontinue using their products or services. The primary goal is to proactively identify at-risk customers, enabling businesses to take targeted actions to retain them. In this workshop, we utilize the 'supermarket' dataset to gain a better understanding of this concept. We label churn customers and build a churn prediction model using Logistic Regression.

## Section 4: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation
- [Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation](https://github.com/ween3654/Advanced_Aanlytics-MADT8101/blob/main/section4%3A%20Customer%20Segmentation%20%26%20Product%20Recommendation/readme.md) üßë‚ÄçüöÄ <br>
 This project illustrates the concepts of customer segmentation and product recommendation through the example of a networking marketing business called 'HDI,' which operates in multiple countries in South East Asia, offering products such as honey, propolis, royal jelly, and pollen. The project is divided into two parts: In the first part (segmentation), the workshop provides Python code for clustering using Autoencoder, an unsupervised Artificial Neural Network. In the product recommendation part, the Python code covers collaborative filtering techniques (item similarity) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization.

## Section 5: Voice of Customer 
- [Voice of Customer](https://github.com/ween3654/Advanced_Aanlytics-MADT8101/blob/main/section5%3A%20voice%20of%20customer/readme.md) üìå <br>
 This project focuses on utilizing topic modeling techniques to analyze audience comments from a YouTube post discussing "Comparing Digital Deposit Options in Thailand" by a Thai Financial Influencer. The objective is to extract valuable insights and uncover underlying themes within these comments, enabling banks to formulate effective strategies for launching new digital banking products.
