Above picutre is concept how to calcuate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). However, CLV can (and should) be refined by taking other factors into account, such as:
- Discount Rate: To account for the present value of future profits.
- Churn Rate: The rate at which customers stop using Agoda's services.
- Margin: To focus on profit instead of revenue. 

⚖️ An example with hypothetical numbers:
Let's assume:
APV (Average booking value on Agoda) = $200
APF (Customers book three times a year) = 3
ACL (On average, a customer uses Agoda for 5 years)

  CLV = $200*3*5 = $3,000 
 
In this simplified example, the average customer would be worth $3,000 to Agoda over their lifespan as a customer.
